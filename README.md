simpleds-kickstart
==================

Demo application using Jersey, Guice and SimpleDS on Google AppEngine.

To get the project started, download gradle >= 1.0rc2 and execute <code>gradle eclipse</code>.

Import the project into your eclipse workspace and create a Web Application launcher. The project compiles your classes directly on war/WEB-INF/classes, so you can just launch and open your browser. 

For an introduction to all this, see [this presentation at Codemotion 2012](http://www.slideshare.net/icoloma/codemotion-appengine)
